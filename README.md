# Beach-Resort

This project is a made-up beach resort application where the user can browse through the resort's features and activities, and has an advanced filter to find the best-suited room for the guests. 

# Purpose
I made this beach resort application to put my React.js and a mix of Context API, functional and class components skills into practice. It was a fun and engaging way of building my first product as if it were for an actual client. 

# Status
This project is currently still in development. I keep adding new features and improving upon previous builds in my free time.
